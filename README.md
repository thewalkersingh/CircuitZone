## Arduino Projects Repository

Welcome to my Arduino Projects repository! This collection includes a variety of projects utilizing Arduino microcontrollers to explore areas like automation, sensor interfacing, IoT, robotics, and embedded systems. Each project demonstrates different use cases and functionalities of the Arduino platform.
Project List

1. **Battery Management System**
   -Description:
   This project showcases a Battery Management System (BMS) designed to manage the temperature of a rechargeable battery. The system uses an Arduino Nano to monitor the batteryâ€™s health and activates a cooling system when necessary to prevent overheating.
   -Hardware Components:
   -Arduino Nano
   -Temperature sensor, Voltage sensor
   -Motors, servos, relays
   -Features:
   -Monitoring the battery temperature and displaying it
   -Keeping the battery temperature below nominal 
   -Auto shut the charging and alarm if the system is not working
2. **Hand Gesture Project**
   -Description: A music play system with hand gesture sound change
   -Hardware Components:
   -LCD, LEDs, resistors
   -Infrared Module
   -Key Highlights:
   -Change the volume of the player by hand gesture.
   -Display the volume level on the screen.
3. **Home Automation**
   -Description: A smart home automation system controlled via a normal TV remote
   -Hardware Components:
   -Arduino nano
   -IR receiver
   -Relay 12V
   -Key Highlights:
   -User can control any appliance with a remote.
   -Sleep mode, pressing a button will turn off all the devices except the fan.
